# Lyricist

This is a bot that can be used while chilling on discord listening to music with friends. It is designed to make it easier for the user to obtain the lyrics of a particular song they need.

Notable Features:
- A quiz feature in the bot to check how much you know your favorite artist.
- Want to get the lyrics of the current playing song in Spotify? You do not have to search the name of the song to search for its lyrics anymore! You're just a command away from finding the lyrics to the song.

Tech used: 
- Python language for running the bot.
- Reddit and Genius lyrics APIs are used to get memes and lyrics for the bot.
- Deployment of the bot on the Heroku server.
